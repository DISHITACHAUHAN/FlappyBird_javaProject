# JavaProject - FlappyBird
Project Name: FlappyBird
<br>
<br>
 -> This project helps improve problem-solving and critical thinking by creating a simple game. It teaches how to handle game logic, collisions, and real-time events using code, encouraging logical thinking and creative solutions.
 <br>
 <br>
-> The game is built using Java with an Object-Oriented Programming approach. It uses different classes for parts like the bird, pipes, and game rules. Java's graphics are used to create movement, detect hits, and handle user input.
<br>
<br>
-> <b>Expected Result:<b>
The game runs smoothly: the bird flies through pipes when the spacebar is pressed, the score increases, and the game resets after hitting an obstacle. It proves that the game works as planned and is fun andÂ interactive.
